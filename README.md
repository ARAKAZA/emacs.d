# Emacs Dotfiles
At the time of writing, I have not written my own emacs configuration but used doom-emacs for the sake of trying out emacs and getting the feel for what is achievable with this great piece of software!

I will, however, write my own emacs configuration at a certain point in time to learn and understand how emacs works internally and hopefully get it to function according to my needs!
