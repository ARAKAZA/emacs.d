* :DONE: Things I ought to do!
- [-] Rounded corners in completion menu (corfu + rounded unicode borders?)

- [-] Get svg-tag-mode to show in other filetypes besides org -> comments only! (:FIXME|)
- [-] Corfu -> quit on escape
- [-] Theme corfu with current used theme?? (+ opacity)
- [-] Fix folding in org-mode. (most likely a corfu isssue)
- [-] Corfu menu -> do not remain displayed after movement!
- [-] Corfu -> broken completions, won't close... (required ~corfu-preselect 'prompt~)
- [-] (ORG-MODE) =<Enter>= -> evaluate source blocks
  - [-] Haskell <- breaks emacs before evaluation == complete (remove `prompt-cont "|>"`)
  - [-] Add missing Rust babel (all languages if possible? or auto setup on buffer enter like lsp-install?)
- [-] (ORG-MODE) =<Enter>= -> evaluate latex block
- [-] (ORG-MODE) Completion and auto-fill blocks + template (tempepl?)
  - [-] Combine with tab complete in corfu
- [-] Less glitchy evil-mode undo?
- [-] Read upon undo-tree + how to retain undo after session restart!
- [-] ability to cycle backwards in mini-buffer.
- [-] PDF-Tools: things to fix
  - [-] Better dark mode
  - [-] +Opacity if possible+
  - [-] Disable number line -> doom modeline
- [-] +Have markdown look similar to org-modern?+
- [-] Snippets..
  - [-] Expand with tab <- corfu to mix with completions + tempel
- [-] Get rid of white theme on cold-start without setting =load-theme=
- [-] Keymaps to match Doom Emacs?
- [] [...] ?
- [] Customize Emacs-conf to surpass nvim-conf
  
* :TODO: Actions
- [ ] LaTeX Setup (CDLaTeX + texlab-like compiling from nvim (tectonic???))
- [ ] (ORG-MODE) Rust babel <- :FIXME| issue with main package...
- [ ] Completion + Tab behavior.. (insert tab when no word prior to completion = desired)
- [ ] (ORG-MODE) Inline completion Eglot.. :FIXME| issue with current eglot implementation!)
- [ ] Fix background of Emacs dashboard logo + latex preview images! (:FIXME| Emacs problem -> nothing to be fixed...)
- [ ] Better modeline design? <- ...
- [ ] Tell remaining applications to replace tabs -> 4 spaces!
  - [ ] Perhaps even untabify on entry or something?

let x = 32;
let y = 12;

println!("{} and {} results in {}", x , y , x*y);
#+end_src
